        <p>Alexander Pushkin (1799-1837) is considered the father of Russian Literature. He sparked a sense of Russian nationalism with the creation of this new Russian literary culture which the population had not seen previously. 
        He is celebrated heavily and memorialized throughout Russia. Pushkin’s upbringing was very influential in his journey to writing. Like many other children born to families of high society during this time period,
         Pushkin grew up speaking French and reading French literature. He modeled his dreams of the modernizing Russian after events and literature in other Western European countries, and then he featured prominently and satirically in his works. 
         Many of his writings include passages or epigraphs in French because those literate in Russian society at the time were schooled in French. They could speak and understand French better than they could in Russian. Many of these works, 
         such as <i>The Bronze Horseman</i> and <i> Eugene Onegin</i>, have been deemed “untranslatable” due to the nature of “Russian verse.” Much of what makes these texts uniquely Russian is the sounds that Russian carries, which was revolutionary at the time. 
         Many of his works are alluded to by future great Russian novelists such as Dostoevksy and Tolstoy. </p>
